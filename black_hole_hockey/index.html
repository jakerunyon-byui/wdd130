                <vegas-msg>People outside of Las Vegas don't understand the strengh of our community. The Golden Knights
                    made their debut just days after the One October Mass Shooting that crippled our city. Hockey has become
                    a rallying point in this city. A lot of people didn't think that hockey would succeed in Sin City. Those
                    people fail to realize that there is so much more to Las Vegas beyong The Strip. Black Hole Hockey Club 
                    wants to serve a gathering place for our beloved 702.

                <goalie-msg>Goaltending is equal parts art, science, and chaos. The Black Hole Hockey Club believes that
                    we have unlocked a method to madness to developing goalies. By utilizing cutting-edge technology like
                    augmented reality and virtual reality prospective goaltenders can practice all facets of the game even
                    if they aren't on the ice. Auston Matthews has become the league's best scorer and he come from Phoenix, AZ.
                    Who says that a future Vezina winner can't come from Las Vegas?
