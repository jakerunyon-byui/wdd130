      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Hockey has been booming in Nevada ever since the NHL awarded an NHL franchise to Las Vegas. In 2017 there were 
          a total of 4 ice skating rinks with public access. Since then, there are now 9 rinks with additional facilities 
          in development. The increase in hockey interest has led to increased demand for hockey instruction. The Black Hole 
          Hockey Academy offers camps, clinics, and private instruction to beginning, intermediate and advanced level hockey 
          players. Our state-of-the-art facility offers an array training programs including skating, stick handling, shooting, 
          weight training, and tactical strategy. Our website will allow southern Nevada residents to sign up for the many 
          offerings we provide.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The growing Las Vegas hockey community is my target. I want to assist in spurring the growth of hockey. 
          As the sport is becoming more popular, parents and new players will want to find a place that will help them
          develop to become their best. ]</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is going to lay out the options. I want it to look clear and concise. I want the main images on the 
        page to be large and attention grabbing. The main page should be easy to navigate and lead users directly to where 
        they want to go. Minimal in design and practical in its application. Whether a visitor is wishing to find information 
        on clinics, or information private sessions, they’ll know where to find it. I also want to have the contact information
        and address easily displayed on the page. When visiting a website, I think visitors should be able to see the contact 
        information without much effort.  I want to have the address, phone number and email address listed in the either the 
        head or the footer. For photos, I want to include at least 1 photo of kids playing hockey or skating and another photo 
        of teenagers displaying more advanced mechanics or level of play. The colors of the page are mean to incorporate the 
        natural colors of hockey. White = Ice, Black = Puck, Grey/Silver = Sticks/skates, red = goal posts. The font is meant 
        to be sporty and sharp.
